I'm in the Coingecko premium+ group with their researchers and analysts and I sometimes know answers to questions that they need to look up.
I have two whale friends that I never met that trust me with their money.

My top under the radar pick: UPlexa (UPX). Remember them? They were hyped as hell 1,5y ago then died and forgotten. Now they reorganized and are building the TOR network with its onion addresses in quicker and more privacy layers (+incentives of course).

I have been involved in governance of both highly decentralized multinational research teams as well as highly centralized public safety organizations.  

I hope it's okay to suggest a new position here.  I am staying up at night thinking of all the new ways we can use on-chain voting to organize on the social layer.  I see value in this not only for our DAO, but also for all future DAOs.  I think we are actually breaking new ground with some of the ideas that are being discussed about how we organize.

Developing new ways to do governance is directly in line with the Bankless mission as I understand it.  By innovating new ways for crypto-natives to organize, especially around media creation and education, we are providing tooling that can be used by anyone. Sister DAOs could spin off and get up to speed faster by learning from our formation process.

Essentially I think it is worth thinking about how power works within Bankless DAO and writing about this.  Also innovating new ways to encourage more contribution and involvement around the activities that achieve our vision of One Billion Bankless.  Maintaining a long-term view of governance and seeking solutions.
